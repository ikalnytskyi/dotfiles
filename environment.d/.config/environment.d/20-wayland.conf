# When using nouevea or nvidia, the cursor sometimes disappaers or not rendered
# at all. Apparently this is a hardware issue (or a driver bug). Let's use

# The Java GUI toolkit has a hard-coded list of "non-reparenting" window
# managers. If using one that is not on that list, there can be some problems
# with running some Java applications. For instance, one of the most common
# problems is "gray blobs", when the Java application renders as a plain gray
# box instead of rendering the GUI. Since we're using Sway, we better
# explicitly say that it's a "non-reparenting" window manager.
